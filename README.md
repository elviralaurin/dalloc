# dalloc - a naive malloc
This repository contains the code written for a seminar at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.

The task consisted of writing simple versions of C library functions malloc and free, in order to better understand the underlying processes of memory allocation.

The code is accompanied by a report, here available as a PDF.
